Update phpMyEdit.class.php for PHP version 8 (compatible with PHP v7)

Based upon Patrick Goupell's Update for PHP version 7 (October 2018)
  (http://www.yooperlinux.com/sites/default/files/downloads/phpMyEdit-5.8.0.zip)
  with additional edits and fixes derived from Kimball Rexford and other
  contributors at https://kimballrexford.com/phpmyedit-for-php7-and-mysqli/

Tested under PHP v8.0.13 (Windows, Android/Termux), v7.3.3 (Windows), and v7.4.1 (Linux/Centos7),
using a basic calling program generated by phpMyEditSetup.php, as well as more complex calling programs of my own.

A goal of this release is to produce a Development version that generates no Errors, Warnings, or Notices. Accordingly, error_reporting=E_ALL, which will reveal additional undetected errors, or introduced errors.
Two versions are PHP v7 are known to me; both generate around 2.5Mb of Notices & Warnings with E_ALL after a single run of one of my calling programs, although both execute successfully in PHP v7 (they crash PHP v8). Note that earlier versions of phpMyEdit had similar error rates. Many of these errors seem to be inexplicably deliberate.

YMMV: Your mileage may vary! Compare my code to an earlier version if you encounter errors.

For Production use, change E_ALL to E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE (line 3283).

Apart from fixes to the code (some enumerated by posters at kimballrexford.com), the most consequential changes were to MySQLI configuration, described in README.MYSQLI_and_UTF8.md

Feedback, suggestons, improvement welcomed.
