Update phpMyEdit.class.php for PHP version 8 (compatible with PHP v7)

Based upon Patrick Goupell's Update for PHP version 7 (October 2018)
  (http://www.yooperlinux.com/sites/default/files/downloads/phpMyEdit-5.8.0.zip)
  with additional edits and fixes derived from Kimball Rexford and other
  contributors at https://kimballrexford.com/phpmyedit-for-php7-and-mysqli/

Tested under PHP v8.0.13 (Windows, Android/Termux), v7.3.3 (Windows), and v7.4.1 (Linux/Centos7),
using a basic calling program generated by phpMyEditSetup.php, as well as more complex calling programs of my own.

A (perhaps naive) goal of this release was to produce a Development version that generates no Errors, Warnings, or Notices. Accordingly, error_reporting=E_ALL, which will reveal additional undetected errors, or errors introduced by the update.
Two versions of phpMyEdit.class.php for PHP v7 are known to me; both produce about 2.5Mb of Notices & Warnings with E_ALL after a single run of my calling programs, although both do conclude successfully in PHP v7 (they both crash in PHP v8). Earlier versions of phpMyEdit had similar error rates. Many of these errors seem to occur by design.

YMMV: Your mileage may vary! Compare my code to an earlier version if you encounter errors.

For Production use, change E_ALL to E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE (line 3283).

Apart from fixes to the code (some enumerated by posters at kimballrexford.com), the most consequential changes were to MySQLI configuration, described in README.MYSQLI_and_UTF8.md

Feedback, corrections, suggestions, improvement all welcomed.
