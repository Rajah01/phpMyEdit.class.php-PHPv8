Update phpMyEdit.class.php for PHP version 8 (compatible with PHP v7)

Based upon Patrick Goupell's Update for PHP version 7 (October 2018) (http://www.yooperlinux.com/sites/default/files/downloads/phpMyEdit-5.8.0.zip) with additional edits and fixes derived from Kimball Rexford and other contributors at https://kimballrexford.com/phpmyedit-for-php7-and-mysqli/

Tested under PHP v8.1.1 (Windows), v8.0.13 (Android/Termux, Windows), v7.4.1 (Linux/Centos7), and v7.3.3 (Windows), using a basic calling program generated by phpMyEditSetup.php (Goupell PHP7 version, included in above ZIPfile), as well as more complex, legacy calling programs of my own.

A (perhaps naive) goal of this release was to produce a Development version that generates no Errors, Warnings, or Notices. Accordingly, error_reporting=E_ALL, which will reveal additional undetected errors, or errors introduced by updates. Two versions of phpMyEdit.class.php for PHP v7 are known to me; both produce about 2.5Mb of Notices & Warnings with E_ALL after a single run of my calling programs, although both do conclude successfully in PHP v7 (both throw fatal errors in PHP v8). Earlier versions of phpMyEdit had similar error rates. Many of these errors seem to occur by design.

For Production use, change "E_ALL" to "E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE" (line 3283).

YMMV: Your mileage may vary! Compare this code to an earlier version if you encounter errors.

Essential changes may be required to MySQLI configuration. See README.MYSQLI_and_UTF8.md

Feedback, corrections, suggestions, improvement all welcomed.
